This is v2 of Albatross Theatre website, a 7+ years long project I've started in 2006, re-building Albatross theatre's website from scratch, deploying, and maintaining it until 2014.

The impact of the new site as a marketing tool was striking: in just three years ticket price for a show went from 100 rubles to 400 rubles, additinal shows were scheduled, and theatre's revenue increased dramatically. This allowed for new shows to be staged, as well as attracting new partners to perform on the road.

*Technologies used to build this website: DHTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, third-party API integration.*
